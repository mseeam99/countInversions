Project Name: Count inversions using various sorting algorithms



Contributors: Alfonso, Mohammad, Nathan, Lucas



The objective of this project is to analyze Quick-Sort (O(nlogn)), Merge-Sort (O(nlogn)), Bubble Sort (O(ùëõ2)) and modify these algorithms to count the inversions in the data supplied to them. Using these modified algorithms, 5 sources of combined rankings are to be sorted and have their inversions counted. The resulting inversion counts will be used to determine source reliability with higher numbers of inversions being less reliable and lower inversion counts being more reliable.



# To compile and run
clear && javac inversionCount.java && java inversionCount.java



# Tools and Frameworks used 
* Created using `Visual Studio Code`

* Tested using `openjdk version "20" 2023-03-21`

* System used to test: `MacOS` (should work on any system)
